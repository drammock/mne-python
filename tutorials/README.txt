This page contains narrative tutorials about how to use MNE-Python, ranging
from first steps (like how to load data) to advanced analysis techniques. New
users are advised to work through the tutorials in sequence at least through
the first 4 sections (Working with continuous data, Preprocessing, Epochs and
Events, and Analyzing evoked responses). Users interested in source imaging
should also work through the sections XXX, YYY, and ZZZ. The remaining sections
deal with advanced topics and do not follow a specific order.
