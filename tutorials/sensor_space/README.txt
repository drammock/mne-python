Analyzing data in sensor space
==============================

This tutorial series assumes no prior experience with MNE-Python, and will walk
you through loading, preprocessing, analyzing, and plotting data in "sensor
space" (i.e., this tutorial does not cover estimating the location of source
activity in the brain that gave rise to the sensor readings).
